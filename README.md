# Magic Leap 2 Eye Tracking Interaction Project

This Unity project enables advanced eye-gaze interaction on Magic Leap 2, featuring customizable parameters for a target interactable sphere, as well as different modes for gaze-based interactions.

## Project Overview
- **Unity Version:** 2022.3.52f1  
- **Magic Leap SDK Version:** 2.5.0  
- **Magic Leap 2 OS Requirement:** Version 1.10.0 or later  
- **Scene for APK Build:** SampleScene

## Setup Instructions

### Device Preparation
1. **Update Device OS:** Ensure that your Magic Leap 2 device is running OS version 1.10.0 or higher to support required features.
2. **Eye Tracking Calibration:** Calibrate eye tracking on the device before using the app. Detailed setup and calibration instructions can be found in the [Magic Leap 2 Documentation](https://developer-docs.magicleap.cloud/docs/guides/ml2-overview/).

### APK Installation and Debugging
1. **Install APK or Download Debug File:** Use Magic Leap Hub 3 to install the APK or access debug files. Download [Magic Leap Hub](https://ml2-developer.magicleap.com/downloads).
2. **Debug File Location:**  
   After running the app, the `debug_file.txt` file will be saved at:  
   `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.ColumbiaCGUI.MagicLeap2EyeTracking/files/debug_file.txt`

## Application Overview
This version of the application provides interaction controls similar to the HoloLens version, allowing users to adjust parameters for a target interactable sphere in the scene.

## UI Controls

### Sliders
Configure the target interactable sphere:
- **R-radius:** Sets the radius of the target sphere.
- **X, Y, Z Position:** Sets the position of the target sphere along the respective axes.

### Toggles
- **Is Recording:** When enabled, records debug data for analysis.
- **Gaze Sphere:** Displays a cyan sphere representing gaze depth, calculated by a custom model, which is also used for interaction detection.
- **ML Gaze Sphere:** Displays a yellow sphere representing gaze depth as calculated by the Magic Leap SDK.
- **Ray Interaction:** Toggles interaction mode. When enabled, switches from sphere-collider interactions to raycasting, using the combined gaze position and direction directly from the Magic Leap SDK. In this mode, the custom modelâ€™s calculations do not influence interaction recognition, as combined gaze data from the SDK is used directly.
